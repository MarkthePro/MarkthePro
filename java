A high-level, 
object-oriented 
  programming language called Java was created in the middle 
  of the 1990s by Sun Microsystems, which is now owned by Oracle Corporation. 
  Because of its well-known platform independence, Java programs can operate unaltered on a variety of computing platforms. 
  The Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which interprets and runs Java bytecode, is used to do this.
